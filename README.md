I purchased Angela Yu's, "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy. This repository will reflect my growth as I complete the journey into spinning my web.

I am a Metroid fanatic and have a passion for Nintendo IPs such as Mario, Zelda, Kirby, and Donkey Kong. My favorite time is family time; my wife and two children keep me well, I cannot complain. I am a Veteran of the United States Air Force disabled after a 15-year career. After my separation, I focused on Linux Admin and peered into Python. I earned my AAS, Information Technology degree a couple of years ago and have recently begun working on front-end web development. I love reading, mostly sci-fi, about FreeBSD, Linux, and the latest updates on cybersecurity fundamentals.

My development machine dual boots Windows 10 Pro and Fedora 34 Workstation. It houses an Intel i7-8700 CPU, 16GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM, and an 8GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU. I do a majority of my development learning on Fedora, as I appreciate the open-source background and ease of use, but I am not afraid to use Windows as a testbed either. I have fewer Nvidia drivers issues in Windows, but hardware aside, Fedora is worthwhile. I recommend it to anyone, expert and beginner alike.

I have a lot to learn and rely heavily on Ms. Yu's Web Development Bootcamp for my current development education. I use other sources to reference things I learn here, but I devote most of my time to her channel. Cheers!
